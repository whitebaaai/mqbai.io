										<h3>Reorganizing the Coasts of Fragility in the Pacific Ring of Fire: Following
											the Trace of Sulfur Movements</h3>
										<p></p>

										<body>
											<p>Early scientific reports in 2007 by the Intergovernmental Panel on
												Climate Change (IPCC) estimated a sea-level rise of under 60 centimeters
												by 2100. This figure does not include the possibility of rapid ice flow
												from Greenland or Antarctica into the sea, which could substantially
												increase the sea level by up to 65 meters. The Paris Agreement of 2015,
												with its goal "to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to
												1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels," has underscored
												the urgency of pushing for economic and social transformations to
												decarbonize.</p>
											<p></p>

											<p>The North American west coast, along the Pacific Ring of Fire, hosts
												clusters of large metropolitan areas operating across complex
												intercontinental industrial networks. This network constitutes the
												emergent notion of the Pacific Ring of Fire. The rise in sea levels
												poses threats to Canada’s largest western commercial port in British
												Columbia, the Silicon Forest in Oregon, Hollywood in California, and
												Silicon Valley in the Bay Area. As a sample of the entire Ring of Fire,
												these metropolitan regions represent a complex web of fragility; damage
												to these networks could have cascading effects on other intertwined
												global industrial chains.</p>
											<p></p>

											<p>The project is an architectural curation of knowledge aimed at
												establishing
												a space for negotiations and collaborative opportunities among diverse
												interest groups. These cultural cohabitation hubs would foster
												collaborations among local governments, foreign immigrants, First
												Nations, and emerging technological elites. The establishment of these
												cohabitation hubs within the cross-border region of
												Vancouver-Seattle-Portland would address critical decisions regarding
												wetlands preservation, future urbanization developments, and the
												relocation of industrial lands. The project envisions a sustainable
												future by transforming a land of fragility into a land of possibilities
												to achieve decarbonization.</p>

										<h2>The Pacific Ring of Fire under Transformations</h2>

										<h2>The Crisis of the Pacific Ring of Fire</h2>
										<p></p>
										<p>Climate change triggers sea-level rise, submerging the Ring of Fire at the
											Pacific Ocean’s border. Along the circular contour of the volcanically
											active Pacific Ocean lie abundant industrial resources important to the
											Anthropocene.</p>
										<p></p>
										<p>Tectonic movements cause the collision and destruction of lithospheric plates
											under and around the Pacific Ocean. These continuous subduction zones, where
											volcanoes are created and earthquakes occur, push up indispensable deposits
											of natural nutrients and fertilizers, including sulfur, copper, palladium,
											nickel, and platinum, which support the development of the contemporary
											world.</p>
										<p></p>
										<p>The Pacific Ring of Fire has evolved from a geological term based on tectonic
											movements and mining sources into a geological extractivist concept.
											Industrial extraction infrastructures, logistic networks, and coastal
											metropolises are additions to the emerging concept of the neoliberal economy
											around the Pacific Ring of Fire.</p>

										<div class="col-md-12 animate-box">
											<div class="portfolio-item">

													alt="Image 1" class="" loading="lazy" width=auto height=auto>

											</div>
										</div>

										<p></p>
										<p>The booming economy of industrial mining and its logistics has also
											transformed the urban cultures of coastal metropolises. Among the foreign
											diaspora in these major coastal metropolises are large Chinese communities,
											significantly contributing to the cities' growth with investments in land
											properties. Along the North American west coast, Vancouver is one such
											metropolis that has undergone economic transformations, along with Seattle,
											Portland, and the Bay Area. From an anonymous mill town to one of the
											world’s most advanced technological hubs, Vancouver has become an essential
											part of the evolved notion of the Pacific Ring of Fire.</p>
										<p></p>
										<p>While sea-level rise urgently threatens the coastal harbors along the Ring of
											Fire, it is necessary for metropolitan regions to reorganize mineral
											commodity supply chains to manage the emergent transformations.</p>
										<p></p>
										<p>Operational disruptions at the Vancouver port, Canada's sole international
											commercial port on the west coast handling mineral commodity imports and
											exports, will trigger a comprehensive reorientation of physical
											infrastructures and networks. Such physical transformations may incite
											conflicts over jurisdictions, ownership of unceded lands, cross-border
											policies and laws, and social structures. These conflicts could involve the
											First Nations, the Canadian government, the US government, and the Chinese
											community.</p>

										<p>Laying on the coast are large piles of
											sulfur, the by-product of crude oil awaits to be distributed to the rest of

										<p>Within the same geographic area also lies a series of natural threats,
											including active volcanic activity. Eruptions of Mount Baker and associated
											hazards, such as lava flows, flank failures, and spawning lahars or
											mudflows, are major concerns due to their ability to travel tens of
											kilometers from the source into populated areas without warning. A 2010
											landslide and debris flow from Mount Meager, a volcano in British Columbia,
											Canada, exemplify the significant threat posed by spontaneous flank
											failures.</p>

										<p>Since 2008, Chinese outward real estate investment has increased more than
											200-fold, reaching approximately US$33.7 billion by mid-2014. Favorable
											currency exchange rates and efforts to internationalize the renminbi have
											motivated Chinese investors to pursue opportunities abroad.</p>

										<p>On the policy side, the Chinese government has taken action over the years
											to encourage outward investment as part of its "Going Global" agenda. In
											October 2014, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce adopted revised "Measures for
											Foreign Investment Management," which permitted domestic firms to invest in
											non-sensitive countries and sectors without prior government approval;
											previously, such approval was required for all overseas investments over
											US$100 million.</p>

										<p>In May 2015, China announced the Qualified Domestic Individual Investor
											(QDII2) program, a pilot set of regulations that would allow individuals
											with at least one million renminbi in financial assets to invest directly in
											overseas financial assets and real estate. As a result of uncertainties from
											China’s slowing economy and political reform agenda, investors tend to
											diversify their holdings by investing overseas.</p>
